## Introduction

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. It provides pre-built React components and hooks for sign-in, sign-up, user profile, and organization management. Clerk is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be dropped into any React or Next.js application.

The user onboarding flow plays a crucial role in your application development journey, and Clerk significantly simplifies this process with built-in tooling like [customizable session data](https://clerk.com/docs/users/metadata#public-metadata), [middleware](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#auth-middleware) in the [Next.js SDK](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/overview).

This repo is a working implementation of a full stack Next.js app showcasing how to leverage Clerk for your user onboarding flow and includes the following:

- Fully functional auth flow leveraging the Account Portal
- Hooks for accessing user data and authentication state
- Customized clerkMiddleware to leverage state for redirect


## Demo

A hosted demo of this example is available at [https://sample-onboarding-app.clerkpreview.com/](https://sample-onboarding-app.clerkpreview.com/)

## Running the template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-onboarding-sample-app
```

To run the example locally, you need to:

1. Sign up for a Clerk account at [https://clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up?utm_source=github&utm_medium=template_repos&utm_campaign=onboarding_sample_app).
2. Go to the [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=template_repos&utm_campaign=onboarding_sample_app) and create an application.
3. Set the required Clerk environment variables
4. `pnpm install` the required dependencies.
5. `pnpm dev` to launch the development server.

> _Alternatively, to use npm instead of pnpm, first delete the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file and run `npm install` and `npm run dev`_
